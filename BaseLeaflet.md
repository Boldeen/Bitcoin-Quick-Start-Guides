# What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a currency that’s completely owned and controlled by you. It is the worlds first truly **scarce** digital asset. 
It can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party transmitter, like a bank. 

# Why the current system is broken 

Banks charge you fees, your pounds are consistently being devalued and it’s extremely hard to exchange or send currency for global use. 

# Why is Bitcoin better

Bitcoin, like the internet, is not controlled by any government. Your Bitcoin payment can’t be confiscated or stopped. 
Governments can’t decide to print more of it, and there-by devalue the currency (or your savings) **Scarcity matters** 

Bitcoin is different than what you know and use every day. Before you start using Bitcoin, there are a few things that you need to know in order to use it securely and avoid common pitfalls. 

# How to accept Bitcoin 

Your bitcoin is stored in a digital wallet. You can download one right now and be ready to accept bitcoin in just a few minutes. We recommend ‘Blockstream Green Wallet’ as a great place to start. Search in Apple’s App Store or the Google Play Store. 

# How to send and receive Bitcoin

Sending and receiving bitcoin works similarly to email. Your wallet will provide an address to receive your bitcoin to. It will look similar to this

You could also say ‘It’s the biggest peaceful demonstration against the system that the world has ever seen’.

The internet’s global distributed technology has done orders of magnitude more for human welfare than any government programs or charities. 

Bitcoin is next. 

A permissionless vehicle for safely storing your time and energy is a human right.
